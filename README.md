Hi, I'm Tim!  Right now, I'm learning about generating static websites with Jekyll,
how am I doing so far?  I feel like it's got a bit of a Geocities vibe to it.

So, about me; I like doing origami, I live in the Denver Metro area, and I'm light
on my feet.  I play the guitar, but I'm only okay at that.

If you're a potential employer, here's what you want to probably know; I'm a decent
Ruby on Rails developer, with a couple of years' full-time, RoR developer experience.
I've been working in IT for the last 22+ years.  For most of that time I was on-call 
for system administration work; check servers, bring them up when they're down,
and running network cables.  Along with this kind of work, I've participated in 
several larger scale software deployments, with the end result of monitoring internal
infrastructure, which extended across the continental United States, as well as 
Australia.

My interest is to take what I know about System Administration, and apply it as best
as I can manage, to the practice of developing reliable, robust software solutions.
