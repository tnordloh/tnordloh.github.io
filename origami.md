# Sixteen Triangles

This is a modular Origami piece, from the book
[Mind Blowing Modular Origami](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXQTYK5/),
where 16 triangles are interwoven.

## This is just a pile of the pieces, before anything is attached!

## This shows the first eight triangles.  That happened fast!

## Here, I've added four more triangles; they are interwoven so that they are sort of inverted into the first eight, and the last four triangles will match up in a similar pattern as the first eight red/yellow triangles do.

## This shows the interweaving of the first eight, and a little bit of how the next eight wrap around them.

The pattern is the same as with the yellow/red triangles, but sort of stretched and 
moved, to make room for the other triangles already occupying the space.

## Here's the same pattern, from a slightly different angle:

This shows how the purple triangles are set as the reverse, or maybe the inverse,
of the yellow triangles.  They are tilted, to weave through all the other triangles, but essentially, the points are wrapped around the center legs of the yellow triangles.  This effect is also mirrored for the green/red triangles.

# Nebula

This is a modular Origami piece, also from
[Mind Blowing Modular Origami](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXQTYK5/),
where six pentagonal shapes are interwoven.

Here's the basic form; the purple pentagonal shape is 50% complete, along with two arms
of each of the other shapes.  To maintain the shape, some fishing string is tied around 
almost all of the shapes.

## This is the same shape, held in my hand, to give a rough idea of scale.

## Here, I've added the third arm to all but the purple pentagonal shape.

## Finished anchor piece

In this step, I finished the purple piece, which is serving as an anchor for the remaining
pieces.

## Almost done

Here, the Nebula is nearly complete. Interweaving the legs required a lot of trial and error.

## Here, the second shape is complete!
